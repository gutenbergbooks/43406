<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To the Invincible Republic" is full of a generous and
admiring appreciation. All of these poems are explicit,
strong, and interesting.&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>

<p><i>Times</i>&mdash;William Watson is, above all things, an artist who
is proud of his calling and conscientious in every syllable
that he writes. To appreciate his work you must take it as
a whole, for he is in line with the high priests of poetry,
reared, like Ion, in the shadow of the Delphic presences
and memories, and weighing every word of his utterance
before it is given to the world.</p>

<p><i>Athenæum</i>&mdash;His poetry is a "criticism of life," and,
viewed as such, it is magnificent in its lucidity, its
elegance, its dignity.... We revere and admire Mr. Watson's
pursuit of a splendid ideal; and we are sure that his
artistic self-mastery will be rewarded by a secure place in
the ranks of our poets.... We may express our belief that
Mr. Watson will keep his high and honorable station when
many showier but shallower reputations have withered away,
and must figure in any representative anthology of English
poetry.... "Wordsworth's Grave" is, in our judgment, Mr.
Watson's masterpiece ... its music is graver and deeper,
its language is purer and clearer, than the frigid
droning and fugitive beauties of the "Elegy in a Country
Churchyard."</p>

<p>Its colors are elemental, silver and gold and red. It is heavy with
the breath of citron groves, cool with the tinkling of temple bells,
and the air of night, and the cries of wild peacocks and parrots....
In many ways this volume of translation is the most important
contribution to poetry that the season has as yet brought forth.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Baltimore Sun</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>There is nothing stale or hackneyed in this book; newness, freshness,
and variety are found on every page. These poems are true lyrics, for
they give us true glimpses into the hearts of men.</p>

<p><i>The Chicago Tribune</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A volume of passionate love poems written by a true poet.</p>

<p><i>The Chicago Inter-Ocean</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>They are in several metres, handled always with graceful ease, and
often with intensity. The coloring is vivid and the music subtle. The
book is redolent with the atmosphere of the Arabian Nights.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Boston Evening Transcript</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Mr. Hope is a thorough artist to his fingertips, and his choice of
words and images is as keen and exact as his ability to adapt Indian
literature to the more prosaic mood and tongue of the Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p><i>The Athenæum</i>:</p>

<p>Mr. Hope has caught admirably the dominant notes of this Indian love

<h3>STARS OF THE DESERT</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Laurence Hope</span></p>

<p><i>The Washington Mirror</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The author has so completely infused the charm of the Orient into this
volume that one is transported for the time and lost in the poetic
beauty of his surroundings, finds no jarring chord nor is disposed to
shrink from the frankness of this translation of oriental verse.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The <a id="chicago_tribune"></a>Chicago Tribune</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It is still a question whether these are direct translations or
whether they are written in the Hindu style by Laurence Hope. Perhaps
she has done for the Hindu poets what FitzGerald did for Omar.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Conservator</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>He seems to exhale an oriental atmosphere. He sings musically. I can
follow the delicate strain by which Hope saves himself from stepping
beyond the bounds of a vital reserve.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The New York Star</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The author is imbued with the glowing passion of Eastern romance.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The New York Globe</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The theme, in almost every instance love, is treated with feverish
abandon.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The English speaking world has waited a thousand years for a worthy
dramatic impersonation of King Alfred. And here it is.... The play
will stand not alone upon the grateful response it wins from the
English national heart, but as a work of art.... The author is
supremely a poet, the master of metaphor not less than of melody....
It is a play not only to be read but to be acted.... This vivid drama
is not cast in the conventional classic mould. It is distinctly and
wholly English in spirit and form, and intensely modern&mdash;but breathing
the air of morning, of springtime, of fresh adventure.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry
Mills Alden</span>, <i>The New York Times Saturday Review</i>.</p>

<p>King Alfred's noble and vigorous character is limned with great skill,
while Elfreda, a graceful and innocent maiden, flits through the play
like a woodland fairy.&mdash;<i>The Glasgow Evening News</i>, Scotland.</p>

<p>The living Alfred lives in this gracious play, for the author has
fashioned his great spirit out of the mist of time.&mdash;<span class="smcap">James
Douglas</span>, <i>The Star</i>, London.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>The Nation</i>&mdash;An uncommonly masculine volume.</p>

<p><i>Chicago Record-Herald</i>&mdash;What every admirer of this virile poet
desires, a brief summary of his important work from which an adequate
conception of his style and versatility can be obtained.</p>

<p><i>Athenæum</i>&mdash;There is urgent need for a collected edition of Mr.
Davidson's poems and plays. The volume and variety of his poetry ought
to win for it wider acceptance. It is indeed curious that poetry so
splendid as Mr. Davidson's should fail to get fuller recognition.
There are many aspects of his genius which ought to make his work
popular in the best sense of the word. He has almost invented the
modern ballad.... He handles the metre with masterly skill, filling it
with imaginative life and power.</p>

<p><i>Times</i>&mdash;There are not more than two or three living writers of
English verse out of whose poems so good a selection could be made.
The poems in the selection are not only positive&mdash;they are visible.</p>

<p><i>Literary World</i>&mdash;We count ourselves among those to whom Mr. Davidson
has made himself indispensable.</p>

<p><i>Daily Mail</i>&mdash;Mr. Davidson is our most individual singer. His variety
is as surprising as his virility of diction and thought.</p>

<p><i>St. James's Gazette</i>&mdash;This volume may serve as an introduction to a
poet of noble and distinctive utterance.</p>

<p><i>New Age</i>&mdash;The book contains much that Mr. Davidson's warmest admirers
would best wish to remember him by. There is a subtle charm about
these poems which eludes definition, which defies analysis.</p>

<p><i>T. P.'s Weekly</i>&mdash;Mr. Davidson is one of the most individual of living
poets; he has a rare lyrical faculty.</p>

<p><i>Morning Post</i>&mdash;Mr. Davidson is as true a poet as we have now among us
... he has included nothing that we do not admire.</p>

<p><i>Daily Graphic</i>&mdash;This delightful volume.</p>

<p><i>Dundee Advertiser</i>&mdash;Its poetry gives out a masterful note.... Mr.
Davidson's poem pictures.</p>
